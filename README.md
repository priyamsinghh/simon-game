## How to Play

* Open the index.html file in your web browser.
* Press any key to start the game.
* Watch and remember the sequence of colors played by the game.
* Click the colored buttons in the same sequence as the game.
* If you get the sequence right, the game will proceed to the next level with an additional color.
* If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.
  
## Features
* Randomly generated color sequences for each level.
* Sound effects for each colored button to provide audio feedback.
* Visual animations to highlight the user's input.
* Game over state with a red background and a restart option.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
*jQuery (to simplify DOM manipulation)

## Styling
The game's interface is styled to have a retro arcade feel, with the "Press Start 2P" font imported from Google Fonts. The buttons have distinct colors, and when clicked, they display a temporary animation effect.
